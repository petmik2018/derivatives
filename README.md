# derivatives methods
Here is the comparison of 1-order differentiation numerical methods:
1. numpy.diff
2. numpy gradient
3. 3-points differentiation
4. 5-points differentiation
5. finite elements method +conjugate approximation

the results of the calculations are compared with the "exact" values
of the analitic derivative. You can choose the test function as you like.
